It was a dusty, hot afternoon as Jimbo Jonny walked into a fine Jackson, Tennesee saloon. It had been a very long trip from the gold mines out west and Jimbo was dragging-his-caboose tired. Jimbo was wearing his old worn out duster, his trusty hat and his boots that were about as tired as he was. On his right hip, as always, was strapped his 6 shooter.

Jimbo left nigh two months ago after he received an urgent letter from his sister Anne. It read that that their little brother Bart was spending time with members of the infamous Tom Bell Gang.

As Jimbo entered and his eyes began to adjust to the dark room, he was able to see the bar to his left, a bunch of empty tables and chairs in front of him and a piano against the wall. The bar tender said:

"Good day. What can I get for you."

"A shot of Tequila" said Jimbo, as he sat down at one of the stools. As his eyes fully adjusted, Jimbo saw some empty bottles on the bar within arms reach. A fleeting thought passed through Jimbo's mind that the bartender must be somewhat lazy to leave these out all night. 

At a loud clamour, three men came stumbled out from the back room into the main room with Jimbo. Clearly drunk, they didn't notice Jimbo at first. They were loudly talking and shuffling towards the bar. One of them stammered:

"Who the hell are you, sitting in my bar?"

Turning around, Jimbo noticed that one of these drunk men was his brother. That made these other two a part of the Tom Bell Gang and the one who spoke must have been Tom himself.

What does Jimbo Johnny do next?
