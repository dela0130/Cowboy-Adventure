After a moment of thinking, Jimbo decided to test the man's wits.

"I'll tell you what. Pick a side, head or tails. If I flip this coin and you win, you will never see me in this bar again. If I win, you and your posse can go find another bar to visit for the time being."

The man looked back at the other two, and bursted out laughing.

"Really? Is that right? I will never see you in this bar again off a coin flip?"

"What do you say?"

"Alright, should be easy enough. Tails."

Jimbo flips the coin and it lands on his palm. He flips it onto the back of his hand. It lands on tails, and Jimbo offers him another try.

"No way lady luck is on your side. Tails."

Jimbo flips it again. Tails. He stays silent, preparing for another coin flip. 

"One last time. Tails."

Being a firm believer in the gambler's fallacy, Tom was assured that it would land in his favour. Using a two-headed coin, Jimbo already knew he had won from the start.

"Unbelieveable. You did something sly!"

The whole bar was watching in awe.

"A deal is a deal." 

Bart and the other man are holding him and dragging him out by his arms while Tom shamelessly thrashes about.
