Jimbo felt his stomach drop, sweat dripping down his brow. His gaze shifted to his brother Bart, who was looking sheepishly at his feet, before returning to the red-faced leader in front of him. He hated confrontation, never had a taste for fights. Tom was a big man -- easily several heads taller than Jim and built like a horse. Even drunk, it would be a tough fight. He subtly shifted to check his hip, ensuring his gun secure and out of view. He silently prayed he wouldn’t need to use it. 

“Are you deaf, dumb, or mute?” Tom sneered, “I asked what you are doing sitting at my bar?” Jimbo swallowed audibly and opened his mouth to ready a reply

“Tom Bell! I haven’t seen you in a beat!” 

Tom whipped his head towards the bar where the bartender caught his attention. He had a wide grin plastered on his face, which didn’t quite reach his eyes. 

“What? I was just here yest-“

“This fine man was just talking about how he was passing through town and trying to make some friends along the way, weren’t you…?”

“Jimbo,” he finished for the man, nodding in acknowledgement. “Right, friends. I heard lots of stories from my brother, Bart.” The bartender and men all turned to look at Bart, who hiccupped and shrugged. Tom growled disapprovingly.

“Here. Drinks for new friends, compliments of Jimbo,” said the bartender, passing along two glasses of a clear liquor to Tim and the other man. He gave a leveled look towards Bart, offering him a frown instead of his own glass.

Tom and the other man grinned, never ones to turn town a free drink. They raised their glasses to Jimbo before swallowing the liquid in one quick gulp. The men placed down their glasses on the bar before promptly crumpling to the floor. Jimbo jumped, startled and confused. 

“What did you give them?” Jimbo asked incredulously. The bartender shrugged, casually glancing at the empty bottles. He took away the empty glasses, whistling as he walked away. Jimbo turned to Bart, who looked ready to bolt for the door. He quickly grabbed his arm before he could.

“We need to talk.”
