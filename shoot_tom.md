Jimbo reached for his pistol, but Tom was faster and drew his first, and he pointed it directly at Jimbo. Jimbo stood frozen with his hand on his pistol.

"I knew you were nothing but trouble." said Tom, "There are too many troublemakers here in Jackson." 

Tom cocked his pistol and said "Time to thin the herd." 

As the pistol's hammer slammed into place, Bart leaped at Tom and tackled him to the floor, knocking Tom's pistol accross the room. This gave Jimbo the chance to draw his 6-shooter, approach Tom  and put the muzzle squarely on his temple. Tom stopped moving instantly.

"Tell your man to drop it!" said Jimbo.
