Jimbo doesn't want to waste his time here. 

"I am not here to cause any trouble. I will take my brother and leave."

Hearing his brother's voice, Bart suddenly had his eyes open and looked at Jimbo surprised. He seemed to wake up just like someone splashed a whole bucket of water on his face. Before Tom had a chance to say anything, he run to Jimbo to give him a warm hug. 

"Brother! I wasn't expecting to see you. These are my friends here." said Bart anxiously. His efforts to mood up the atmosphere seemed not to be working.

Tom gave the two a glance before hitting one of the empty bottles to show his aggression. Glass bottle shattered on the floor with a loud noise.

"You cannot just come to my bar and try to flee with one of my men."
