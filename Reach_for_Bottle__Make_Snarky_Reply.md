Jimbo glanced at Bart. Bart had gone white as a ghost and seemed to be signaling to Jimbo to keep his mouth shut. 

Ignoring the signal, Jimbo looked at Tom and said: "Your bar? If it is your bar, get me a tequila, and if it's your bar..." 

Jimbo slowly stood up, slowly grabbing an empty bottle, he said "...why don't you clean it up?"

Tom stared for a second then burst out laughing, "Dang, old man! You've got some nerve coming in here and speaking like that. Now, I ain't never seen you before, and I asked you a question:" 

Tom put his hand on his pistol. "Who the hell are you?"

Jimbo stood their, in one hand he had the glass bottle, and in the other his hand was on his 6-shooter. He did not have a plan and this could get messy. Just as he began to raise the bottle to smash it on the bar, in burst a flash of color. Anne came rushing in with a big red dress and shreiked,

"Ohh, I knew it was you Jimbo, I'm so happy you're back! Why didn't you come straight home?"

As Anne came in to hug Jimbo, Tom disgustedly yelled "Alright guys let's get out of here, we've got business".

Over her shoulder, Jimbo noticed Tom sneering at Jimbo as he walked by. Tom said loudly as he left: "Bart, you never said you had a brother."

"No one looks at me like that!" [Reach for your 6-shooter](/shoot_tom.md)
